## Description

A nationwide retail corporation is planning to develop a new **distributed store management system** named **DE-Store**. This system is not an online shopping platform but a distributed business management system designed to enhance store management and coordination. DE-Store is expected to be expandable and adaptable to future business needs.

### Key Functionalities

1. **Price Control:** Allows store managers to set product prices and apply various sales offers.
2. **Inventory Control:** Monitors stock levels and automatically orders out-of-stock items from the central inventory system. Generates warnings for low stock items.
3. **Loyalty Card:** Provides special offers to frequent customers.
4. **Finance Approval:** Integrates with an existing finance system ("Enabling") via a portal to offer buy now, pay later options.
5. **Reports and Analysis:** Tracks customer purchase activities and generates performance reports.

### Tasks

1. **Architecture Recommendation:** Propose two architectures for DE-Store, detailing the components, connectors, and protocols.
2. **Architecture Selection:** Choose one of the proposed architectures and justify the choice based on expected quality attributes.
3. **Prototype Development:** Design and develop a prototype to demonstrate the architectureâ€™s principles.
4. **System Evaluation:** Reassure the company of the expected quality attributes in the final system.

## Submission Guidelines

1. **Software Architecture Specification:** 
   - Discuss the two considered architectures and justify your choice for the prototype.
   - Include design and evaluation of the full system.
   - Recommended length: 8-20 pages, font size 12, including diagrams.

2. **Source Code:** 
   - Submit all source code of your prototype via the Moodle coursework submission link.
   - Ensure the prototype system structure is as complete as possible.

3. **Demonstration:** 
   - Create a 5-minute video demo explaining your prototype.
   - Use a screen capture tool to record and explain the functionality.
